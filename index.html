            <h1>Salvador Dali was a painter that impacted the world of surrealism greatly.</h1>
            <p>He was a Spanish painter who was born in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain. He attended school in Madrid, where he practiced his art. In 1931 he created The Persistence of Memory, which is his most commonly know piece today. Dali was always naturally talented, and from a young age was producing intricate drawings. I've always been intrigued by his work, and his unique sense of imagery.
